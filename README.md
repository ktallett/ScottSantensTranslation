# ScottSantensTranslation
Translating Scott Santens articles on basic income. 


The following articles should be translated into as many languages as possible.

http://www.scottsantens.com/basic-income-faq

Fork the repository and please always commit. I shall try to get around to adding to main as often as possible. If starting a new language then please create a new folder. For each article you wish to create please create an issue with the language and the article name. This is so people can check here and also the folders see what articles are currently being worked on, or have already been done and there wont be any multiples of same article. We can close the issue once your translated article has been added to the main.
